        <h2>AI MiniPaper Tool - Instructor Guide</h2>
        
        <p>The AI MiniPaper Tool is designed to collect and grade short papers written with AI assistance. Students submit papers using CKEditor 5.0, with feedback provided through comment streams. The tool supports instructor grading, peer review comments, flagging for moderation, and comprehensive student analytics. This guide covers all the features and settings available to instructors.</p>

<h4>Pedagogical Approaches and Settings Combinations</h4>
<p>The AI MiniPaper Tool is flexible and can be configured to support various pedagogical approaches. Here are several common use cases and recommended settings:</p>

<h5>1. Peer Review Focused Assignment</h5>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Emphasize peer learning and feedback skills.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Submit points:</strong> 10-20 points (encourages submission)</li>
    <li><strong>Instructor grade points:</strong> 0 points (no instructor grading)</li>
    <li><strong>Points per comment:</strong> 5-10 points</li>
    <li><strong>Minimum comments:</strong> 3-5 comments required</li>
    <li><strong>Use actual student names:</strong> Unchecked (anonymous peer review reduces bias)</li>
    <li><strong>Allow all after minimum:</strong> Checked (encourages continued engagement)</li>
    <li><strong>Allow reset:</strong> Optional (depends on whether you want students to revise)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Developing critical thinking, improving writing through peer feedback, large classes where individual instructor feedback is impractical.</p>

<h5>2. Instructor Graded Assignment</h5>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Traditional instructor evaluation with optional peer engagement.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Submit points:</strong> 10-20 points</li>
    <li><strong>Instructor grade points:</strong> 50-80 points (main grade component)</li>
    <li><strong>Points per comment:</strong> 0 points (must be 0 when min_comments = 0)</li>
    <li><strong>Minimum comments:</strong> 0 (peer review is optional, but won't count toward grade)</li>
    <li><strong>Use actual student names:</strong> Checked (traditional approach)</li>
    <li><strong>Allow all after minimum:</strong> Checked (if peer review is enabled)</li>
    <li><strong>Allow reset:</strong> Unchecked (final submission)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> High-stakes assignments, detailed instructor feedback needed, smaller classes.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Since minimum comments is 0, points per comment must also be 0. Peer review can still be enabled for learning purposes, but comments won't contribute to the grade calculation.</p>

<h5>3. Completion-Based Assignment</h5>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Track completion and encourage reflection without heavy grading.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Submit points:</strong> 50-100 points (full credit for submission)</li>
    <li><strong>Instructor grade points:</strong> 0 points</li>
    <li><strong>Points per comment:</strong> 0 points</li>
    <li><strong>Minimum comments:</strong> 0</li>
    <li><strong>Use actual student names:</strong> Checked</li>
    <li><strong>Allow reset:</strong> Checked (allow revisions)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Low-stakes assignments, reflection exercises, participation tracking, formative assessment.</p>

<h5>4. Hybrid Peer Review + Instructor Grading</h5>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Combine peer learning with instructor evaluation.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Submit points:</strong> 10 points</li>
    <li><strong>Instructor grade points:</strong> 50 points (quality assessment)</li>
    <li><strong>Points per comment:</strong> 5 points</li>
    <li><strong>Minimum comments:</strong> 3 comments required</li>
    <li><strong>Use actual student names:</strong> Checked (accountability in peer review)</li>
    <li><strong>Allow all after minimum:</strong> Checked</li>
    <li><strong>Allow reset:</strong> Unchecked (final submission)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Balanced assessment, developing both peer review skills and meeting quality standards, medium-sized classes.</p>

<h5>5. Anonymous Peer Review</h5>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Reduce bias and encourage honest feedback.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Submit points:</strong> 10-20 points</li>
    <li><strong>Instructor grade points:</strong> 0-30 points</li>
    <li><strong>Points per comment:</strong> 5-10 points</li>
    <li><strong>Minimum comments:</strong> 3-5 comments</li>
    <li><strong>Use actual student names:</strong> <strong>Unchecked</strong> (key setting for anonymity)</li>
    <li><strong>Allow all after minimum:</strong> Checked</li>
    <li><strong>Allow reset:</strong> Optional</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Reducing social pressure, encouraging honest critique, addressing bias concerns, sensitive topics.</p>

<h5>6. Scaffolded Peer Review</h5>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> Gradually build peer review skills with structured requirements.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Submit points:</strong> 20 points</li>
    <li><strong>Instructor grade points:</strong> 30 points</li>
    <li><strong>Points per comment:</strong> 5 points</li>
    <li><strong>Minimum comments:</strong> Start with 2, increase to 4-5 in later assignments</li>
    <li><strong>Use actual student names:</strong> Checked initially, then unchecked as students gain confidence</li>
    <li><strong>Allow all after minimum:</strong> Checked</li>
    <li><strong>Allow reset:</strong> Checked (encourages iterative improvement)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> First-time peer reviewers, building review skills over time, courses with multiple assignments.</p>

<h5>General Tips</h5>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Total points:</strong> Keep overall points reasonable (50-100 total is common). Remember: Overall points = instructor_points + submit_points + (comment_points × min_comments)</li>
    <li><strong>Minimum comments:</strong> Set based on class size. For classes of 20+, requiring 3-5 comments ensures everyone gets feedback. For smaller classes, 2-3 may suffice. <strong>Important:</strong> If minimum comments is 0, set points per comment to 0 as well, since comment points won't contribute to overall points when min_comments = 0.</li>
    <li><strong>Flagging system:</strong> Use flagging to identify problematic content early. Anyone can flag, but only instructors can unflag, providing a moderation safety net.</li>
    <li><strong>Generated names:</strong> When enabled, instructors can still see real names (with generated names in parentheses), maintaining accountability while providing student privacy.</li>
    <li><strong>Reset feature:</strong> Enable reset if you want students to revise based on feedback. Disable for final submissions or when you want to preserve the original submission.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Settings</h4>
<p>Configure the assignment settings including:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Submit points:</strong> Points students earn for submitting their paper (can be zero)</li>
    <li><strong>Instructor grade points:</strong> Points you will award for the assignment (can be zero)</li>
    <li><strong>Points earned for each comment:</strong> Points students earn per comment on other submissions (can be zero)</li>
    <li><strong>Minimum number of comments per student:</strong> Required comments each student must make (can be zero). If zero, students can comment on any submission.</li>
    <li><strong>Use actual student names:</strong> When checked, display real names. When unchecked, students see generated names (e.g., "Purple Elephant") and instructors see real names with generated names in parentheses (e.g., "John Doe (Purple Elephant)")</li>
    <li><strong>Allow students to see and comment on all submissions after the minimum has been met:</strong> When checked, students who have met the minimum comment requirement can see and comment on all submissions. When unchecked, they can only see submissions they have already commented on.</li>
    <li><strong>Allow students to reset and resubmit their papers:</strong> Enables the Reset Submission feature. When a student resets, their submission becomes editable again and comments are soft-deleted (hidden from students but visible to instructors).</li>
    <li><strong>Due date:</strong> Optional due date for the assignment</li>
</ul>

<h4>Instructions / Rubric</h4>
<p>Edit the assignment instructions and rubric that students will see. Use the rich text editor to format your content. This is displayed to students in the Instructions section.</p>

<h4>Student Workflow</h4>
<p>Students can:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Write and edit their paper using CKEditor 5.0</li>
    <li>Save drafts without submitting</li>
    <li>Submit their paper (which locks it from editing unless reset is enabled)</li>
    <li>View their submitted paper and AI-enhanced version (if available)</li>
    <li>See comments from instructors, other students, and AI</li>
    <li>Review other students' submissions and add comments</li>
    <li>View their points and review count on the main page</li>
</ul>

<h4>Peer Review System</h4>
<p>The review system prioritizes submissions to help students meet the minimum comment requirement:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Submissions the student has already commented on appear first</li>
    <li>Then submissions that need more comments (oldest submissions with fewest comments)</li>
    <li>If minimum comments is set and not met, students see submissions that help them reach the minimum</li>
    <li>After meeting the minimum, visibility depends on the "Allow students to see all submissions" setting</li>
    <li>Review list is paginated (10 submissions per page)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Grading</h4>
<p><strong>Point Calculation:</strong></p>
<p>Overall points = instructor_points + submit_points + (comment_points × min_comments)</p>
<p>Earned points include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Submit points (if paper is submitted)</li>
    <li>Comment points (capped at min_comments - no extra points for exceeding minimum)</li>
    <li>Instructor points (assigned by instructor, 0 to instructor_points)</li>
</ul>
<p>Grades are automatically sent to the LMS whenever:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A student views their main page (if overall_points > 0)</li>
    <li>A student submits a comment</li>
    <li>An instructor assigns or updates instructor points</li>
</ul>
<p>Grades will only be sent if overall_points > 0.</p>

<h4>Instructor Features</h4>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Student Data:</strong> View all student submissions, grades, and analytics from the Student Data menu with:
        <ul>
            <li>Pagination (20 students per page)</li>
            <li>Sortable columns (Name, Email, Grade, Updated, Comments Given, Comments Received, Flags, Deleted Comments)</li>
            <li>Search by name or email</li>
            <li>Search by generated name (when "Use actual student names" is unchecked)</li>
            <li>Default sort by Flags (DESC), then Name (ASC)</li>
            <li>Flag counts include both flagged comments and flagged submissions</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Grade Detail:</strong> View individual student details including:
        <ul>
            <li>Points earned / points possible</li>
            <li>Review count (number of students reviewed)</li>
            <li>Flag information (flagged comments count and submission flag status, if any)</li>
            <li>Assign instructor points (integer from 0 to instructor_points)</li>
            <li>Review Submission button (preserves pagination/sort/search state)</li>
            <li>Reset Submission button</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Review Submission:</strong> Click "Review Submission" from grade detail to view and comment on a student's paper. Navigation context (page, sort, search) is preserved when navigating back.</li>
    <li><strong>Comment Moderation:</strong> Hide/show individual comments using the trash can icon. Hidden comments are soft-deleted (visible to instructors, hidden from students, still count for points).</li>
    <li><strong>Flagging:</strong> Flag comments or submissions for review. Anyone can flag; only instructors can unflag. Flagged items are indicated with red flag icons.</li>
    <li><strong>Comments:</strong> All instructor comments are marked as "Staff" and visible to students</li>
    <li><strong>Soft-Deleted Comments:</strong> When a submission is reset or a comment is hidden, comments are soft-deleted (visible to instructors with indication, hidden from students, still count for points)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Generated Name Search</h4>
<p>When "Use actual student names" is unchecked, students see generated names (e.g., "Purple Elephant") instead of their real names. Instructors can search for students by their generated name using the "Search by Generated Name" field in the Student Data page. This is useful when you only know a student's generated name.</p>
<p>Generated name search results appear in the main Student Data table with sorting disabled. The search is mutually exclusive with regular name/email search - entering one clears the other.</p>

<h4>Test Data</h4>
<p>If your LTI key is '12345', you can access a test data generator from the Instructor menu to create 100 dummy users with submitted papers for testing the review system.</p>
